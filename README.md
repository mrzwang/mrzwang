# Hi!

I am a student at MIT majoring in the intersection of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Artificial Intelligence, with a particular interest in Machine Learning.

## Research

### In-Context Learning for Esoteric Programming Languages  
**Description:** Developed a zero-shot, in-context evaluation framework that extends LLM reasoning to esoteric languages without any additional fine-tuning. Built a modular pipeline to compare full versus minimal context prompting and introduced a lightweight in-context reinforcement method that delivered measurable improvements on custom “EsoEval” benchmarks over standard HumanEval.

## Projects

### Neural Network Adversarial Patches
**Description:** Explores the vulnerability of convolutional image classifiers to adversarial perturbations. Implements both brute-force and optimization-based methods for generating adversarial examples on MNIST, including a learned additive noise layer using Keras' functional API.

### UCOPC 2024: Optimal Team Selection for USA Gymnastics at Paris  
**Description:** Finalist project in the Undergraduate/High School division of the 2024 UCSAS Statistical Data Science Challenge, with poster featured at the conference. Developed a dual-method framework for selecting optimal five-member teams for the USA Men’s and Women’s Artistic Gymnastics programs ahead of Paris 2024. The first method applies linear assignment modeling to optimize event-specific lineups based on individual expected scores; the second leverages statistical inference (including t-tests and Type II error analysis) to identify high-impact all-arounders capable of minimizing medal upset risk. The pipeline integrates data cleaning, performance simulation, and ranking methodologies to balance specialization and team consistency under Olympic scoring constraints.
