# Hi!

I am a student at MIT majoring in the intersection of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Artificial Intelligence, with a particular interest in Machine Learning.

## Research

### In-Context Learning for Esoteric Programming Languages  
**Description:** Developed a zero-shot, in-context evaluation framework that extends LLM reasoning to esoteric languages without any additional fine-tuning. Built a modular pipeline to compare full versus minimal context prompting and introduced a lightweight in-context reinforcement method that delivered measurable improvements on custom “EsoEval” benchmarks over standard HumanEval.

## Projects

### Neural Network Adversarial Patches
**Description:** Explores the vulnerability of convolutional image classifiers to adversarial perturbations. Implements both brute-force and optimization-based methods for generating adversarial examples on MNIST, including a learned additive noise layer using Keras' functional API.
