## Featured Work

### Computer Use Agentic AI
**Description:** Developing an autonomous browser interaction system using both AutoGen framework and Azure's Computer Use Preview API. This project enables AI models to navigate web interfaces through a sophisticated action handling system supporting clicks, typing, scrolling, and keyboard shortcuts. The implementation features custom Hugging Face model integration with function-calling capabilities, safety checks for user approval, screenshot-based visual feedback loops, and automatic tab management. The system maintains context awareness through URL tracking and provides detailed reasoning summaries, creating a human-in-the-loop experience where AI can perform web tasks while allowing human supervision. The architecture supports both streaming and synchronous completions with configurable model parameters, providing a foundation for research into autonomous web navigation capabilities.  
**Note:** This is proprietary work in progress; source code is not publicly available at this time.

### RL Adversarial LLM: Reinforcement Learning Framework for LLM Code Generation 
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repository-181717?style=flat&logo=github)](https://github.com/mrzwang/rl-adversarial-llm)

**Description:** Developing an adversarial reinforcement learning framework for enhancing language model capabilities, implementing both PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) and GRPO (General Reinforcement Policy Optimization) algorithms. The system focuses on RL fine-tuning sub-4B parameter models by pitting two models against each other. In this adversarial training framework, two language models compete against each other in real-time, continuously improving through reinforcement learning feedback loops. This creates a adversarial game where models learn to generate increasingly sophisticated code by attempting to outperform their opponents.

### NGFuzz: Neural-Guided Adversarial Fuzzing Framework  
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repository-181717?style=flat&logo=github)](https://github.com/mrzwang/ngfuzz)

**Description:** Combines traditional AFL fuzzing with neural network guidance to intelligently direct input mutations for enhanced software vulnerability discovery. Implements gradient-based optimization and adversarial input generation to systematically explore rare and complex program paths. Features continuous model retraining for adaptive fuzzing that evolves with program behavior, significantly improving code coverage and bug detection efficiency.

### In-Context Learning for Esoteric Programming Languages  
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repository-181717?style=flat&logo=github)](https://github.com/mrzwang/In-Context-Learning-for-Esoteric-Programming-Languages)

**Description:** Developed a zero-shot, in-context evaluation framework that extends LLM reasoning to esoteric languages without any additional fine-tuning. Built a modular pipeline to compare full versus minimal context prompting and introduced a lightweight in-context reinforcement method that delivered measurable improvements on custom "EsoEval" benchmarks over standard HumanEval.
